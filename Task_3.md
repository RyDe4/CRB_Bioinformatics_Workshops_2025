## Searching and Loading Modules on OSC

OSC has many popular bioinformatics tools pre-installed which are accessible through their module system.
-To see all available software use the command `module avail`.  
-To search for specific software packages, you can use the `module spider <software name>`. The `module spider` command can also be used to find out more specific steps that may be needed to load certain software tools.  
-To load a software tool, you can use the `module load <software name/version>` to load a specific version of a software tool.

## Using fastqc

-Load fastqc using the command `module load fastqc/0.12.1`, or a different version depending on what cluster you are on. It is important to take note of the version of software you are using since journals require you to put this information in the methods section when you publish.
